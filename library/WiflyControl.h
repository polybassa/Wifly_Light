 *
 * 
 * The WiflyControl class allows the user to control the Wifly_Light Hardware.
 * There are three target's at the Wifly_Light Hardware.
 * - Bootloader<br>
 *           All methodes with Bl* relate to the bootloader part.
 * - Firmware<br>
 *           All methodes with Fw* relate to the firmware part.
 * - RN-171 Wifi Interface<br>
 *           All methodes witch Conf* relate to the communication module.
